# Startup Plugin for BuntyWP

This is a WordPress startup plugin for me. But you can also use if you will find it useful.

## Quick start

```bash
$ npx bwp-starter-plugin "Plugin Name"
```

The name provided (`Plugin Name` in the example) defines the plugin name for the scaffolded plugin.

_(requires `node` version `20.10.0` or above, and `npm` version `10.2.3` or above)_

## Usage

The `bwp-starter-plugin` command generates a plugin with PHP, JS, and CSS code for a custom WordPress plugin.

```bash
$ npx bwp-starter-plugin "[plugin-name]"
```

### Interactive Mode

After running the command, the script will run in interactive mode and will start prompting for the input required (`slug`, description, etc...) to scaffold the plugin.
